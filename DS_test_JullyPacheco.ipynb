    "Since better input data will result in a better overall performance of any model, the first step that will be developed is an overall study of the dataset.  From the information  on the main source in Strack et. al. 2014 (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/), and Table 1 of the supplementary material (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/tab1/),  we have the following preliminary insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The extraction of this dataset from a bigger one was done by clinical experts who consider that all the 50 features of this specific dataset could be important to evaluate the effectiveness of the medical treatment of patients with diabetes\n",
    "\n",
    "- In some cases, there are several entries registered for the same patient to the hospital. In the study performed in the source article, multiple entries for the same patient (identified by the \"patient_nbr\" column) were considered as not independent, and for the sake of using a Multivariate Logistic Regression model, such repetitive entries were removed to leave only one entry for each patient. In that manuscript the discharge motive (\"discharge_disposition_id\", e.j. patients who died or were sent to a hospice were not considered) was also taken into account to reduce the original dataset from 101766 data rows to around 70000\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the source article, the features age, gender, race, admission source, discharge disposition, primary diagnosis, the specialty of physician, time in hospital, and result of the HbA1c test were correlated among them and examined to determine the importance of measuring the HbA1c value to reduce hospital readmissions in less than 30 days. The results showed that primary diagnosis is a crucial factor to determine the probability of readmission in less than 30 days, which is also related to the frequency with which HbA1c tests were taken, independently of their result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 97 % of the data of feature \"weight\" is missing, as well as 52 % and 53 % of the \"payer_code\" and \"medical_specialty\", respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "With basis on these insights, and taking into account that there is a previous report where the study of the influence of the measurement of the HbAc1 parameter on early readmissions (\"readmission\" == '<30') was favored,  the formulation of the scientific problem that is intended to solve here is **to perform a generalization of the conclusions in that study by taking all variables (features) into account in our first approach and evaluating which, if some of them do, represent a cause for early readmission, middle time readmission (\"readmission\" == '<30'), or a thus considered completely effective treatment with no further readmissions (\"readmission\" == 'NO')**.\n",
    "With this, the first treatment that will be performed on the dataset is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The features \"encounter_id\" and \"patient_nbr\" will be removed for not considering them relevant for a classification problem. In this case, considering that there is already an indicator of the frequency of readmission in each row, there are indicators of health conditions in the year previous to each admission, and the fact that we do not know how all of those evolved with time during the period of the ten years the dataset was taken, we will consider all admissions as independent entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although the \"payer_code\" feature could be useful for further statistics, it is not considered as relevant for the specific problem, and as it has more than 50 % missing data, this will also be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The medical specialty did not show to be important for hospital readmission in the previous study of this data set, and it has more than 50 % of missing data; thus this feature will also be disregarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the case of the feature \"weight\", it will be dismissed because of the huge amount of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Note:** We are defining this problem by thinking about the aim of this exercise and the short time available to complete it. This means the additional literature where this dataset is studied has not been taken into account This is important because there are more than 100 publications that cite the source manuscript, more than 50 % of them in the Information and Computing Sciences area. There, it is probable that this problem has been solved already. "

    "At this point, having a better understanding and familiarity with the complete dataset, both in the technical and content aspects, and having into account the poor performance of the model (which can be normal in a first trial), it is time to revisit the feasibility of solving the originally proposed problem. From the acquired knowledge of the data, it is reasonable to think that the initially proposed problem can be too general, and given the nature of the data acquired that were taken without any specific purpose, taking the complete dataset will not necessarily help to solve it. So it important to have in mind that it is possible that we have to instead, define a very specific problem, as for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the correlation found in the source manuscript, determine if there is not only a correlation but a causality between taking the HbA1c test and a probable No-readmission, i.e, given the result of the test, to infer if that induces the physician to administrate some specific medicine that could result in the main factor to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, the dataset was let the most complete possible, and so the solution of several different specific problems can still done; but it is important to know that that problem should be defined before any further data treatment can be performed, and that will depend on what is the specific question one wants to answer. If we want to know if a first hospital entry for mental disease can provoke a diabetic crisis in less than 30 days after leaving the hospital, we should filter and separate the data containing only the information related to those specific diseases. Otherwise, other variables or data points would only increase noise thus avoiding the algorithm to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, after proving better parameters in the model, and different input datasets, the way I would continue to deal with the given dataset is to restart by defining a very specific problem, filtering the data that is certainly related to that problem (remove the data introducing bias or noise), from the datasets here called categorical_data (the encoding form of it),  numeric_normal, and encoded_target,  and only then put it as the input of a model."
